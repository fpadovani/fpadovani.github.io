Hello :)

I am a first year PhD Candidate in the Computational Linguistic Group at the [Center for Language and Cognition (CLCG)](https://www.rug.nl/research/clcg/research/cl/), the University of Groningen (NL). My research is done under the supervision of [Arianna Bisazza](https://www.cs.rug.nl/~bisazza/) and the co-supervision of [Yevgen Matusevych](https://yevgen.web.rug.nl/). 
The VIDI project I will working on, funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO), focuses on improving language modeling for (low-resource) morphologically rich languages, taking inspiration from child language acquisition insights.
