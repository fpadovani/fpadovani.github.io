Hello :)

I am an Italian girl who recently moved to Groningen, I started doing research again after a long year break working for a private company in Italy. I am very excited to get back into language cognition and language models, I am looking forward to be able to give my contribution to make them really “Truly PolyGlot” and more inclusive. 

While I am mainly busy shaping my early researcher profile, I don't miss any opportunity to get up on my bicycle, read novels and essays (most of them transfeminist), and crochet little crafts for myself and all my dear close friends and family *.*
